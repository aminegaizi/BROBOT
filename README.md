# BROBOT
Project designed to use and implement all the available sensors and actuators at iHouse using a Raspberry Pi and a STM nucleo F401RE

## Implemented so far on nucleo board: 
- Bluetooth communication using UART1 and HM-10 Bluetooth Low Energy 
- Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 using internal timer interrupts
